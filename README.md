# ArmatorX's Financial Manager

I'm tired that my finances are a bit messy and that my expense manager puts adds in my face everytime I open it.

So, I'm creating a small, personal, customized, PWA that functions as a expense manager, with added custom functionality, such as:

- Investment tracking
- Objective planning
- Credit card expenses module
- Recurrent expenses
- Shared expenses

It won't connect to any APIs. Only to Firebase for some minor API utilities, like login and data storage.

## What you need

A Firebase account.
